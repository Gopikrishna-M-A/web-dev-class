## Introduction

In the previous session, you explored intermediate CSS techniques to enhance the styling of your web pages. Now, we will shift our focus to JavaScript, the scripting language that brings interactivity and functionality to the web.

## JavaScript Basics

In this section, you will get acquainted with the fundamentals of JavaScript, including:

### Variables and Data Types

- Declaring variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understanding data types: numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and arrays.

### Functions

- Defining functions to encapsulate reusable blocks of code.
- Passing parameters to functions and returning values.

### Basic Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulation

- Accessing and modifying HTML elements using JavaScript.
- Adding event listeners to respond to user interactions.

## Assignment

For today's assignment, you will apply your newfound JavaScript skills to create an interactive web page. Your task is to build a simple webpage that features:

1. A form with input fields.
2. JavaScript code that validates and processes user input when the form is submitted.
3. Displaying results or feedback on the webpage based on user input.

You are encouraged to use the concepts you've learned today, such as variables, functions, and DOM manipulation, to complete this assignment successfully.

Feel free to be creative with your project, and don't hesitate to explore JavaScript further to enhance your web page's functionality.
