## Introduction

In the previous sessions, we covered the basics of JavaScript, including variables, functions, and DOM manipulation. Today, we'll explore more advanced topics that are crucial for building modern web applications.

## Asynchronous JavaScript

Modern web applications often need to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from servers or dealing with user interactions. We'll delve into two essential concepts for managing asynchronous code.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  const data = await fetchDataFromAPI();
}
```

### Promises

Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations more elegantly. Here's an example of using a promise to fetch data from a server:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

# Working with APIs

Many modern web applications interact with external APIs to retrieve or send data. In this session, we'll explore how to work with APIs effectively.

## Fetching Data

We'll use the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to external services and retrieve data.
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
}
```

## JSON Parsing

Most APIs send and receive data in JSON format. We'll cover how to parse JSON data and work with it in JavaScript.

```javascript
const jsonData = '[{"id":1,"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com"},{"id":2,"name":"Jane Smith","email":"jane@example.com"}]';
  
const parsedData = JSON.parse(jsonData);
console.log(parsedData);
```

```javascript
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane@example.com"
  }
]
```

## Day Objective

**By the end of today's session, you will be able to:** 

1. Use JavaScript to fetch data from an external API.
2. Parse JSON data received from the API using techniques such as JSON.parse().
3. Dynamically display the relevant data retrieved from the API on your webpage using DOM manipulation.

Feel free to get creative and add additional features or styling to make your application stand out.
